   cd yourrepo
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Create a `.env` file:**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your secrets.

4. **Run locally:**
   ```sh
   node server_working1.js
   ```
   Or use `npm run dev` if you have a dev script.

## Environment Variables
See `.env.example` for all required variables.

## Deploying to Vercel
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and import your repo.
3. Set all environment variables in the Vercel dashboard (from `.env.example`).
4. Deploy!

**Note:** If using Express backend, you may need to move your server code to `/api/server.js` for Vercel serverless functions, or deploy backend separately (e.g., Render) and use Vercel for frontend only.

## Stripe Integration (To Do)
- Add your Stripe keys to `.env` and Vercel.
- Implement Stripe Checkout on the frontend.
- Handle Stripe webhooks in `/api/stripe/webhook` to credit users after payment.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **AI Model**: FLUX Kontext Professional Headshot (via Replicate)
- **File Upload**: Multer
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Model Information

This app uses the `flux-kontext-apps/professional-headshot` model from Replicate, which is powered by FLUX.1 Kontext Pro. The model specializes in:

- Converting casual photos to professional headshots
- Maintaining facial identity while enhancing presentation
- Adjusting lighting, composition, and backgrounds
- Generating studio-quality results

## Security Notes

- API tokens are stored in environment variables
- Uploaded files are temporarily stored and automatically deleted
- File type validation prevents malicious uploads
- 10MB file size limit for uploads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"No API token" error**: Make sure your `.env` file contains a valid `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`
2. **File upload fails**: Check file size (max 10MB) and format (JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
3. **Generation takes too long**: The AI model typically takes 10-30 seconds to process
4. **Poor results**: Try using clearer, front-facing photos with good lighting

### Error Codes:
- `400`: Bad request (missing image or invalid parameters)
- `500`: Server error (API issues or processing failures)
